CHARACTER COPIER C#

The character copier is a simple class that reads characters from a source and copies them to a destination one character at a time.

The character copier gets the source and destination injected into the constructor.


Copier

When the method Copy is called on the copier, it should read characters from the source and copy them to the destination until the source returns a new line (‘\n’).


MOCS

The exercise is to implement the character copier using mocks for the source and the destination.


C#
This repository contains a C# implmentation for the 'Character Copier'. The solution also includes a additional implementation to read multiple characters simultaneously.
